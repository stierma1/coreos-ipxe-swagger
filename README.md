coreos-ipxe-swagger
===================

Similar to the coreos-ipxe-express application, but this time it has swagger.  
Default port is 4777.  localhost:4777 should bring up Swagger UI.  Put commands
have basic http authentication with username:username, and password:password.

More work to come shortly.
